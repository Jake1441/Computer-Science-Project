The friend had promised him of a connection in a good publishing firm in Nairobi.\r\n \r\nHowever, the friend failed to communicate back; he could not contact him easily because of communication limitations.\r\n \r\n\u201cI lived in a rural area with no electricity neither phones and after doing all the donkey work I ended up loosing my original manuscript\u201d, he says.\r\n \r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t loose hope and I personally made a crucial decision come what may, one day I will publish my novel\u201d, he adds.\r\n \r\nIn March 2007, he managed to publish his first novel, \u2018THE TERRORISTS HUNTER'. He says his greatest fear was how to penetrate the market dominated by the major publishing firms.\r\n \r\n\u201cI started an aggressive marketing strategy targeting key people within my society like lawyers, the clergy, school principals, doctors and the local institutions\u201d, he says.\r\n \r\nStill in the same year,Kenya was to hold its general elections; Gachuhi says he capitalized on chapter 14 in his novel that explains the mobilization techniques of how one can win a democratic election. \r\n \r\n\u201cSeveral political aspirants found it very crucial in their campaigns strategy and they positively appreciated my work and bought the book\u201d, he says.\r\n \r\nMr Gachuhi registered his book at the Attorney General\u2019s office on July 10, 2007 under the literary category.\r\n \r\nThe author says he could write even during the night using a simple kerosene lamp, little did he know his works would later be sold via internet and through bookshops without his personal consent as a copyright holder. \r\n \r\n\u201cThis makes me feel very much distressed whenever I visit the internet to see how my original copyright works is being blatantly commercialized\u201d, he says.\r\n \r\nThe Terrorists Hunter\u2019s author further says, he reported the infringements of his literary work to the State Counsel in charge of copyright registrations at the AG\u2019s chambers who advised him to write a protest letter to the permanent secretary in the ministry of foreign affairs in Nairobi. \r\n \r\nOn March 17, 2009, he point out that he sent a copy of the same protest letter to the United States of America embassy office in Nairobi and personally delivered a hand copy to the permanent secretary in the ministry of Home affairs  in Kenya who told him to wait for a feedback.\r\n \r\n\u201cHitherto, I have not received any communication from the office of foreign affairs neither from the  American embassy\u201d, he comments.\r\n \r\nFurther, he has also written protest letters to some of the Universities in the USA using his work and some have forwarded his concerns to the US government who gave him contact addresses including those of Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) to make the report.\r\n \r\n\u201cI reported to the FBI and they advised me to report to the reproduction department in USA\u201d, he says.\r\n \r\nHe has an email documentary evidence from an Attorney in  Indiana Universities in the US, one of the institutions holding his works who advised him to register his copyright works in the United States of America copyright authorities and find a good lawyer to represent him.\r\n \r\nMr. Gachuhi says he feels disturbed after having done all the tiresome job of writing  fast selling novels that are being used internationally to shape the mentality of the world and he is not getting his rightful dues as the author and the publisher.\r\n \r\n\u201cHonestly speaking, I would highly appreciate if someone guides me on how to register my work in the US and other developed countries so that those who are commercializing with it agree to pay loyalty dues\u201d, he says.\r\n \r\nIn September 24, 2009 he launched his second novel \u2018New World Order Frustrated\u2019 a highly suspense novel that stimulates a reader to form mysterious imagination and makes his or her own judgment in case a disaster strikes.\r\n \r\nThe author says he believes that the ability to imagine is the ability to add value to life. He also adds that he believes in attempting to venture into innovative thoughts that he puts down in writing.\r\n \r\nAccording to Kenya Copyright Board, the copyright law protects the expression of an idea from being copied without authority. It does not protect the concept or the idea, and also it does not protect logos, symbols, titles, short phrases or factual information that may be contained in a copyright work.\r\n \r\nGachuhi also says his works has been translated to other international languages like German and Spanish and has internet documentary evidence.\r\n \r\nHe is also the author of the book, \u2018The Literature Booster\u2019 a guide on Journalistic values, Oral Literature, drama and poetry dedicated to the fans and critics of his debut novel \u2018The Terrorist Hunter\u2019 as he puts it.\r\n \r\nDespite all these, he says he is not a bitter man but happy because he has realized that his works have been recognized internationally and only what he wants is to be given his rightful dues. \r\nENDS.\r\nApril 27, 2010 \r\n\r\nBrief history of David Gachuhi\r\nDavid Gachuhi is a journalistic artists and a former Catholic functionary in Kenya in East Africa.
