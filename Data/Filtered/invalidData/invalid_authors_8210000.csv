{"bio": {"type": "/type/text", "value": "Jadunath Sinha(1892-1978)\r\n\r\nJadunath Sinha was a well-respected philosopher, writer, and religious seeker, and the author of over forty books and numerous articles. The scholarship involved in his writings (ranging from psychology, ethics, logic, and other areas of philosophy to yoga, shakta sadhana, Vaishnavism, and vedanta) is quite impressive.\r\n\r\n\r\n       Jadunath Sinha was born on 24th October 1892 at Kurumgram, Distt. ; Birbhum,West Bengal. His ancestral Village was Khaspur, Distt. Murshidabad , West Bengal, India. His father died in an accident when he was only 5 years old.

Some of the news of the court case in Public Domain are furnished.\r\n1.\tSubcontinental Plagiarism by,Idrees Bakhtiar.\r\n--------There is one person who cannot be ignored. Dr. Sarvepally Radhakrishnan, the former President of India and author of the book on Indian Philosophy. The work was immediately challenged by one Jadunath Sinha a student of Radhakrishnan\u2019s who had submitted his dissertation to him and another instructor. When Radhakrishnan's book was published Sinha wrote a number of letters to Calcutta\u2019s Modern Review  Magazine claiming that passages from his dissertation have been stolen for the book. Radhakrishnan\u2019s misfortune was that many of Sinha\u2019s articles had already been  published in magazines before publication of the book giving weight to Sinha\u2019s claim. The writer is associate editor,The Herald\r\n2.\t Jadunath Sinha wrote in Modern Review,Calcutta -April issue of 1929 \r\n  \u2018 It is indeed true that not only in our unfortunate land, but all over the world, self praise is sought by some by dispraise of others. But this is comparatively a trifling thing. It pales into insignificance when compared with the moral perversity involved in the violation of sacred trust by a cultured and honorable man if and when there is any. I sincerely pray, all scholars, young and old may outgrow this perversity.\u2019\r\n3.\tNotes on Great  Indian Circus by Khushwant Singh  page, 211-212\r\n    Radhakrishnan -------went on to become first King George  V Professor at Calcutta University. He had a setback in his career when one of his student Jadunath Sinha, took him to Court for lifting passages out of thesis and using them in two volumes of Indian Philosophy without acknowledgement. Radhakrishnan denied the allegations and filed a counter suit of libel against Sinha. The cases were compromised. No one knows what the terms of compromise were. The publication of two volumes of Indian Philosophy opened up gates of all prestigious Universities of the world for Radhakrishnan.  Honorary doctorates ,memorial lectures, and honours including a knighthood were showered on him.\r\n  4.\tRadhakrishnan \u2013 A religious Biography  by Robert Neil Minor 1987,page 34,37 With the publication of Radhakrishnan's Indian Philosophy first volume in 1923 and second volume in 1927, the Modern Review began to question Radhakrishnan's use of sources. In 1929 however a distinguished Bengali student Jadunath Sinha (1802-1978) filed suit in the High Court of Calcutta charging Radhakrishnan with infringement of copyright because he has plagiarised some of Sinha's work. Sinha had received numerous prizes from Calcutta University and in October 1922 had submitted a thesis on 'Indian Psychology of Perception' to the university for Premchand Roychand (PRS) Scholarship, which he received later that year. His examiners were Professor B.N.Seal and Professsor Radhakrishnan. The remaining installment of his thesis were submitted untill its copletion in 1925, when he was awarded Mouat Medal by the university. Radhakrishnan and another neo-vedantin philosopher Krishnachandra Bhattaracharya (1875-1949) were his readers. In 1929 Sinha however, charged that Radhakrishnan had plagiarized significant portion of his thesis in-----Volume-II of Indian Philosophy. Sinha who was teaching at that time at Meerut colllege, was convinced that a crime had been committed, he first registered his grievance with a letter to the editor of the Modern Review, dated December 20, 1928, which was published as an article. The letter initiated an exchange between Sinha and Radhakrishnan in the pages of the Review in which Sinha reproduced extracts from his thesis of 1922 and Radhakrishnan's Indian Philosophy of 1927.\r\nThe suit in  High Court of Calcutta in 1929 was met with a counter suit by Radhakrishanan for defamation of character. With mediation of Dr.. Shymaprosad Mukherjee ( the then Vice-Chancellor of Calcutta University) the matter was settled out of court due to threatening financial expenditure and high personal cost \r\n5.\t A reported case of Radhakrishnan\u2019s Literary piracy by Barin De\r\n    www.dk agencies.com/doc/from/1063/to/1123/bkld/---/details html\r\nSummary; Compilation of  reports on allegations against Sarvepally Radhakrishnan made by Jadunath Sinha for inclusion of---latter's thesis in -----. \r\nPost mediation /settlement(1933)of Court Case events;\r\nA)\tJadunath Sinha was awarded Ph.D in1934 by Calcutta University\r\nB)\tTwo (2) of Jadunath Sinha\u2019s books were published in London \r\ni)Indian Psychology ; Perception- Jadunath  Sinha, Publisher-Kegan Paul, London-1934\r\nii) Indian Realism-Jadunath Sinha, Publisher -Kegan Paul, London-1938\r\nThe scholarly books Dr. sinha authored exceed forty (40) in number, besides innumerable  research papers in National and International journals..
